The abstract is a concise 1-page description of the work: what was the
problem, what was done, and what are the results. Do not include
charts or tables in the abstract.

Put the abstract in the primary language of your thesis first and then
the translation (when that is needed).







\chapter*{Preface}

This document template conforms to Guide to Writing a Thesis at
Tampere University of Technology (2014) and is based on the previous
template. The main purpose is to show how the theses are formatted
using LaTeX (or \LaTeX ~ to be extra fancy) .

The thesis text is written into file \texttt{d\_tyo.tex}, whereas
\texttt{tutthesis.cls} contains the formatting instructions. Both
files include lots of comments (start with \%) that should help in
using LaTeX. TUT specific formatting is done by additional settings on
top of the original \texttt{report.cls} class file. This example needs
few additional files: TUT logo, example figure, example code, as well
as example bibliography and its formatting (\texttt{.bst}) An example
makefile is provided for those preferring command line. You are
encouraged to comment your work and to keep the length of lines
moderate, e.g. <80 characters. In Emacs, you can use \texttt{Alt-Q} to
break long lines in a paragraph and \texttt{Tab} to indent commands
(e.g. inside figure and table environments). Moreover, tex files are
well suited for versioning systems, such as Subversion or Git.  
% \url{http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/lshort/english/lshort.pdf}


Acknowledgements to those who contributed to the thesis are generally
presented in the preface. It is not appropriate to criticize anyone in
the preface, even though the preface will not affect your grade. The
preface must fit on one page. Add the date, after which you have not
made any revisions to the text, at the end of the preface.

~ 
% Tilde ~ makes an non-breakable spce in LaTeX. Here it is used to get
% two consecutive paragraph breaks

This document template conforms to Guide to Writing a Thesis Tampere
University of technology (TUT) \cite{thesisguide13}. A thesis or a
report typically include the following chapters:
\begin{itemize}
  \setlength{\itemsep}{-10pt} % Put these lines closer to each other
\item[] Title page           % Empty bracket[] remove the bullet
\item[] Abstract
\item[] Preface
\item[] Contents
\item[] List of abbreviations and symbols
\item[] 1. Introduction
\item[] 2. Theoretical background
\item[] 3. Research methodology and materials
\item[] 4. Results and analysis (possibly split into separate chapters)
\item[] 5. Conclusions
\item[] References
\item[] Appendices (if applicable)
\end{itemize}


\section{In-text citations}



Formatting examples of an journal article in bibliography are provided
below, first in the numeric style and then the name-year style.

% Define columns widths to get text wrapped


Section~\ref{sec:3rd} cannot appear alone, but needs some company
(i.e.~\ref{sec:3rd_partner}).

%Appendices are purely optional.  All appendices must be referred to in the body text
%You can append to your thesis, for example, lengthy mathematical
%derivations, an important algorithm in a programming language, input
%and output listings, an extract of a standard relating to your thesis,
